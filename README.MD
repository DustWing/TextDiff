**Simple Diff application in java swing**

The application uses a simple diff algorithm that uses the longest common subsequence.
It shows the new Inserts and Deletes. Edit is assume to be an insert action.

The UI is not complete since it shows DELETE and INSERT in the middle with signs - or +.
However, it does not  highlight these changes.
